Also i want the story to be small to be fitted in 10 lines and i want you to write the story in Aeshop's writing style. Don't make any conversation and the story will be viewed from a third person angle.The story should have a beginning scenario where you will describe some scenario about the characters and the environment around the characters, a climax part where the audience will be excited to know what is going to happen, their excitement, fear, anger will make the story a success and a ending part that describes the ending of the story.  Also the audience will be children so don't use any hard words that they fail to understand .You will use the places which are located in Bangladesh as almost all the audience will be from Bangladesh so that they become thrilled while reading this story book. And lastly your job is to iterate multiple times with your algorithm so that you make the best output from you and choose which story would be best fit for the audience. Do you get what i said?Reply in yes or no",
